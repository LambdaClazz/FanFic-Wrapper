    <p>Nine years ago Tim stumbled upon Terry and Damian. He didn't mean to, but he eventually got close enough to hear the - to see them. They brought noise to his constant silence.

   <blockquote class="userstuff">
    <p>Hello, I'm back. Now it's time for Tim's origin story. I decided to do it in First Person, but only the parts in the past. It may be a little confusing. I'll try to format it so you'll know when it's the present and when it's the past. However, just as a heads up only the beginning and the end will be in the present. </p>
    <p>Also Tim might be a little "darker" than usual. I just think it's kinda creepy how he joined the Batfam by stocking them essentially, so I'll be playing with that "creepy starker" thing Timbo got going for him. (But don't worry too much, I suck at writing really dark stuff) </p>
    <p>This should be about 9 chapters long (Dear lord, what did I get myself into). </p>

    <p> <strong>The Present...</strong> </p>
    <p>The lock to Damian’s room clicked easily. The doorknob turned silently. Tim entered. He didn’t bother with the lights. He was afraid that he would catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror that sat atop Damian’s dresser. He wasn’t quite sure if he was ready to see himself just yet. Instead he sat at the small workmen’s desk that he saw Damian frequent. Freshly made shuriken were laid neatly in the top corner. Though, a small easel took up the majority of the desk’s face. Tubes of oil paints surrounded the stand. Tim ran his finger along Damian’s half-empty canvas; the beginnings of bright red hair were dry under his touch.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tim smiled. He didn’t think that Damian was sentimental enough to paint a portrait of a love one. However, the smiled fell from his face when he remembered why the painting was only half finished. The thought forced him to push away from the desk, grabbing a shuriken. He twisted the knife in his hand as he waited. He needed Damian. He needed to speak to him. Tim knew that only <em>Damian</em> would do what Tim had planned.</p>
    <p>He ran the tips of Damian’s sharp knives along his calloused fingertips, his mind running. He never thought that he would feel this way again – would want something like this again. Then again, Tim never thought he would be here in the first place. <em>How can such a chance encounter change my life so much, </em>Tim thought, <em>How did I end up here?</em></p>
    <p> <em>I remember the first time I saw the Wayne Brothers. I didn’t actually see them the first time. No, my first introduction to them were their voices.</em> </p> 
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>9 years ago…</strong> </p>
    <p>Father was going away again. Going on a business trip that wasn’t planned, but cannot be missed. He placed me off of his lap, a sad smile on his lips. I knew that expression too well, so there was no need for me to listen as he rattled off details and excuses. However, something he said did catch my ear.</p>
    <p>“So I’m giving you a little mission,” he said. My blue eyes glanced up at him. Mission? I’ve never had a mission before. “Well actually,” Father continued, “It’s a mission for the both of us.” He kneel down, his knee digging into the shrubbery and soft dewy earth in the forest behind our estate. “I want you,” he said pointing a finger to my chest, “To find a bird with a white tailfeather.” I frowned at him and he laughed in return. “They’re out here,” he said. He then gestured to the forest around us. The forest, although not big, was dense. The hanging trees stood tall, almost limitless in their height. Shrubbery and dead leaves piled up to my calf, my Converses lost beneath them. “And while you’re looking, I’ll be looking too.” He then raised his new flip phone, proudly presenting the camera to me. “When I find one, I’ll take a picture of it. You do it too. I’ll be waiting to see what you find.”</p>
    <p>He’ll be waiting. If that’s so, then I must succeed. I can’t let him down. “Ok,” I said, “I’ll look.” A smile blossomed across Father’s face and I could help but to smile too. I don’t smile often, but I’d do it for him. He reached to touch me but stopped short when his phone rung again. It vibrated violently in his hand. Then he was frowning again.</p>
    <p>“I’m so sorry, Timmy,” he said. He then answered as he walked us back to the house. Ms. Samantha met us at the door. “I’ll see you when I get back,” Father assured, like always, with a kiss to my temple, “And remember your mission. I’ll remember mine.” With that Father was gone again. The sound of the shutting door echoed in the empty house. I missed him already.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>-----</p>
    <p>“Lift your arms higher,” a voice advised. I paused in my searching, looking around me. I was completing my mission, face down in the undergrowth as I looked for the white-tailed bird I saw walking by earlier but, a boy’s voice in middle of the woods? “Higher, man,” it directed again. It was amused and I could almost imagine the smile it was birthed from. “C’mon,” they said again. Footsteps followed, then the slapping sound of skin on skin. He must have playfully hit the other. “Don’t leave,” the voice called. It carried across the shrubbery that I was kneeling in. The laugh that followed gently weaved though the hanging leaves. Who was out here?</p>
    <p>“This is foolish,” another said. This voice was different. It was harsher, tinged with the beginnings of embarrassment and frustration. “I obviously cannot do this,” they said. Then the sound of rubber hitting <em>concrete</em> reverberated, and I flinched from how misplaced the sound was. This is a <em>forest</em>, where did concrete come from? Even the birds scattered away from the sound. Though I was a little upset at their departure, It didn’t matter too much that they flew away. None of them had a white tail, anyway. “Get away,” the harsher voice ordered.</p>
    <p>“Stop being so prissy,” the cheerfully voice teased. I then heard a soft growl echo through the trees in response. I wondered if I should leave, however another easy-going chuckle filtered into the air. If the other boy wasn’t afraid then I shouldn’t be either, right? “You can’t be great at everything, you know,” the voice sound again. This time he didn’t sound as carefree. His words were heavy, weighed down with hidden meanings and hidden emotions. “This is something I’m good at,” the boy said, “And I’m trying to teach you.”</p>
    <p>The retreating footsteps stopped, a sigh brushing across my ears. “Ok,” the harsh voice said. Though it was considerably less harsh. “I will play this ‘basketball’,” he continued. I then heard stomping and ruffled clothes. Would the mean boy hurt funny one? “Though if you laugh again,” the other sounded, the growl back in his voice, “I will punch you in the throat.”</p>
    <p>Oh no, he is going to hurt him. Maybe I should get help! Ms. Samantha would call the police. I don’t want the funny one to get hurt. I like the funny one. I stood to run back to the house, though as I brushed the dirt from my jeans (Ms. Samantha didn’t like it when I was dirty and I needed her to focus on my words more than my grass stains), another laugh sounded. This one was dark, though, much to wicked to be out of mirth.</p>
    <p>“Try me,” the supposedly&nbsp;<em>funny</em> voice challenged. Maybe he didn’t need Ms. Samantha after all. Just who did I stumble upon?</p>
    <p>The other voice laughed. “Maybe another time,” it said, “Now show me what I should do.”</p>
    <p>“Put the ball in the basket,” the first voice laughed, “It’s not rocket science.”</p>
    <p>“I’m not to hit the red square,” the other asked. I could feel a frown forming. I don’t even play sports and I know that you’re supposed to put the ball in the basket.</p>
    <p>“What,” the funny voice asked, “No.” I could hear the snicker that lingered in his words. Though he held them back like the other had asked. “The red square,” I could heard the air quotes, “Is a guide.” I then heard the ball bounce twice before the distinct sound of a ball swishing into a net. “Like that.”</p>
    <p>“Child’s play-“</p>
    <p>“Timothy!” I nearly choked on the sharp breath I took in. I wasn’t expecting Ms. Samantha to come looking for me. She only spoke to me when I spoke to her. “Dinner is ready,” she continued. I stood once more, this time dusting the dirt from my knees despite the laugh I heard in the breeze. I had to get to her before she came here. She couldn’t find this spot. She’ll ruin it and the voices might not come back. With that in mind, I dashed across the forest, meeting her in the middle. “It’s time to come inside, Timothy,” she said. She them looked down to my jeans, a frown forming on her face. “Really Timothy,” she said, “Can’t you do anything right? I told you not to dirty your pants.”</p>
    <p>I bowed my head, hoping she wouldn’t pop me for this. “But I was just doing what Father asked.”</p>
    <p>“Your father doesn’t do your laundry,” she retorted. She then grabbed my arm – hard – and pulled me inside. “Just go to your room,” she ordered, “I’ll bring you dinner up to you.”</p>
    <p>“Yes ma’am.” I traveled the long hallways, the dew from my Converses leaving wet marks on the polished floors. I’m sure Ms. Samantha would be angered by this as well. My footsteps echoed around me, but it didn’t matter. In my mind, I was still in the forest. The voices were still talking and laughing around me. As I entered my room, I wondered what their faces looked like. What would the funny one’s smile look like? Was the mean one’s growl just as scare up close as it was from where I was standing? Maybe he could scare Ms. Samantha into letting me watch TV. I laughed at the thought.</p>
    <p>Though, I really did hope the mean one made at least one basket. Maybe he wouldn’t be so mean anymore, and maybe the funny one would laugh more. I laid in my bed and imagined what would it be like if maybe I played with them too someday.</p>

    <p><strong>The Present...</strong> <em><br> </em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <em>The second time I saw the Wayne boys, it wasn’t face to face.</em> </p>
    <hr>
    <p> <strong>9 years ago...</strong> </p>
    <p> <em>&nbsp;</em> </p>
    <p>I rushed to the door from my room, shoes still muddy from the wet earth outside. I had just returned from the woods outback when I heard the lock echoing down the halls. Father returned from his meeting! His eyes were dark and his shoulders sagged but he was back! He hugged me as soon as he entered before he slumped onto the door-frame, a yawn stretching his face wide. “Timmy,” he sleepily murmured, “Don’t I have a picture for you!” I laughed, sleep made his words slip and slide across his heavy tongue. He sounded funny. “Just wait until I dump off this bag,” he continued, though Ms. Samantha’s voice sounded down the hall, telling him to take a nap. “Well dump off this bag and take a nap,” he corrected, “Then I’ll show you what I found. Did you find anything?”</p>
    <p>My shoulder hunched up as guilt froze me. I’ve been to the forest numerous times, my father’s Polaroid in my hand ready to find a bird, but all I found were voices. The playful arguments that circled around me were so lively and louder than anything I’ve heard in a long time. I listened on as instructions turned into scrimmages, and games turned into wrestling matches. Yet, despite all the fighting they still laughed at the end. Breathless chuckles ghosted my ears and piqued my interest. So instead of searching for birds, I searched for the sounds. Father would be so upset if he realized that I didn’t complete my side of the mission. So for the first time in my life, I lied to my father. “Yes,” I said. The word felt as thick as peanut butter on my tongue. Though I continued, “I found something. Just wait until I show you the picture.”</p>
    <p>My father smiled, patting my shoulder gently as he waddled his way up the steps. “I can’t wait to see-“ he threw over his shoulder, but a yawn cut his words. He stumbled into his room and locked the door. I knew that I wouldn’t see him again until evening.</p>
    <p>“Timothy!” I flew from the door as the sound of my shouted name echoed though the empty halls. It was Ms. Samantha. I hunched over as he stormed to me, a mop and bucket in her hand. “Clean this up,” she commanded. She pointed to the muddy trail that lead from the backdoor, to my room and to the front door where I was standing. I startled as she shoved the heavy pail into my hands. I tried to tell her that I had to do something for Father before he woke. “I don’t care,” she answered, “I’m tired of cleaning your messes.” But isn’t that her job? “It’s time you learned to clean after yourself,” she continued, “Go outside once you’re done.”</p>
    <p>My shoulder sagged. I suppose she’s right. I did create that mess, it’s only right if I fixed it. “Yes Ma’am,” I said. Besides, it’s my fault that I didn’t complete my mission. I was so wrapped up in the voices.</p>
    <p>She nodded, a gentle smile blossoming on her face. “Good,” she said, “You’re learning.” She then picked up her purse near the door and swung a thin jacket across her shoulders. “I’ll be back,” she commented. Though the cigarette between her lips muffled her words. “Remember what I told you,” she asked. I dutifully nodded. I remember exactly what she told me. She worked hard, she said, and sometimes she needed a break. She told me that Father would get worried if he knew that she was so tired, so I shouldn’t tell him. Father has enough things to worry about, she had added. She said that I was a big boy, and that I could handle things for myself for a little while. I wanted to prove her right, that I was a big boy, that I could look after myself. Plus if Father had less to worry about, then maybe he’ll sleep more. “Good,” she said. She patted my head a little too hard before she left out the house. The giant door rang loud down the silent grand hallway. I doubt Father even heard it.</p>
    <p>-------</p>
    <p>I felt immensely proud of myself! I cleaned the floors like Ms. Samantha asked. I caught sight of a White-tailed Kite and even managed to snap a photo! The bird was rare to this area, according to the encyclopedia Father had in the upstairs library. Plus to top it off. I heard the boys again. This time it was a match! Apparently, two weeks was all the mean one needed to learn how to play. It seemed intense. They weren’t even laughing this time. I couldn’t stick around to find out the victor, but in my mind the funny one won. Though, I was secretly rooting for the mean one.</p>
    <p>“Timbo,” Father spoke from behind me, his hand on my shoulder. He looked better now that he slept and he had the beginnings of a smile on his face. “Are you going in my office,” he asked, “Because <em>I’m</em> going in my office but you’re kinda blocking my way in.” He laughed at me as he tugged the cordless phone so it sat more comfortably between his shoulder and cheek. He wasn’t really listening to the person on the other line, so I knew that he’d be staying after this phone call.</p>
    <p>“Nope,” I joked, “And you’re not going in either!” I spread my arms out to block him, my legs too. “You’ve worked enough,” I said making my voice scary like Ms. Samantha’s, “Now you have to play with me.”</p>
    <p>“Oh really,” Father asked. He quirked an eyebrow at me, that smile from before in full bloom across his face. “I understand Mr. Jameson,” he spoke down into the phone, “Can you hold on for just a moment, I’m having trouble getting to those files you want me to look at?” He placed the phone down on the floor, before standing and staring me down. Sometimes I forget how big my father was. Maybe blocking him wasn’t the best idea. “So you’re saying that I can’t come into <em>my</em> office,” he laughed, “Ok, we’re going to have to fix that.” He picked me up by the waist and tossed me over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>“Put me down,” I screamed as he shook me. That’s the loudest I’ve been in weeks. He tossed me on the couch in the office. Oh no, he’s going to tickle me isn’t he? As if on cue, he did just as I thought he would. “I give,” I laughed, “I give!”</p>
    <p>“Already,” my Father teased, “I don’t know. You were so tough earlier. I don’t think you’ve learned your lesson.” I begged my father again, my mouth making a noise that I knew I could never make again. My Father laughed, his face turning red, before he lifted me by my arms and placed me on his hip. I blushed. I’m too old to be held like this, but I miss my dad so I guess it was ok. “I guess I can let you up,” he said, “And I also think that I’ve been working too hard.” He shuffled me around a little before going into the hall to pick up his phone. I forgotten he was on a business call. “Let me finish this up.” He sat at his desk with me in his lap. He then pulled out a file. It must be the file he was talking about earlier. “I finally got that file,” he said as he and I shared an amused look, “Though, I don’t see any discrepancies.” He looked over the file, eyes quickly skimming the sheet and taking in the information. I hoped to be as smart as him someday. “I’ll look into this with more depth and get back to you,” he finished, “Ok. Good night Mr. Jameson.”</p>
    <p>“Phone call finished,” I asked.</p>
    <p>Father smiled and nodded, “Phone call finished.” He then bit his lip, his eyes thoughtful. “Timmy,” he said seriously. His smile fell from his face. I’m worried. What’s wrong? He pulled the file from a cabinet. He opened it and it was the same file as earlier. “Look at this,” he directed, “Does the numbers seem off to you?” I looked at the numbers, row after row. These were some of the biggest numbers I’ve ever seen! Not the mention the different words and departments. “Don’t worry about the other stuff,” he said. He must had seen my eyes wandering. “Just the numbers,” he pointed out, “Look at the final four digits and tell me what you see.”</p>
    <p>I did as he asked. The numbers were getting higher. First it increased by thousands, but father said look only at the last four digits so I ignored that. Then the number it was increased by started to go down. It <em>was</em> increasing by the thousands, but then it increased by the hundreds, then by the tens, then not at all. “The numbers aren’t increasing as fast as it used to,” I said.</p>
    <p>“Exactly,” Father answered, “Good job.” He then turned me around and placed me on his desk so we were eye to eye. “Do you know what these numbers represent,” he asked me. I shook my head. I was so confused. Father seemed upset, but he was just fine not too long ago. “They are our company’s profit,” he said, “You remember what I told you that I did for a living.” I nodded. I remembered, he dug up things and sold them to museums so people can learn about the past. “I think someone’s st-,” he cut himself short. He shook his head, sighing, before another smile was placed on his face. “It doesn’t matter,” he said, “You see, your old man has a plan and he’s going to get a friend to help.”</p>
    <p>He pulled out a picture from his desk draw. On it was a tall man. He seemed to be around my Father’s age. I’ve seem him before, whenever I sneaked peaks of the TV when Ms. Samantha wasn’t looking. “Bruce Wayne,” I voiced and my father nodded. I didn’t know who the two boys that were with him in the picture were, though. “Who are they,” I pointed. One was slightly taller than the other, his skin was tanned and his eyes were a clear blue. They reminded me of the sapphire jewels my father sometimes brought back from his trips. They were so deep and dark. The other was paler in complexion, his hair darker and his eyes lighter. They were the color of the sky.</p>
    <p>“The boys,” Father confirmed, “They’re Bruce Wayne’s two sons, Terrance and Damian. I’m sure you’ve heard them from time to time. They live next door. My body stiffened after father spoke, these were the boys I’ve been listening to, but… &nbsp;My father laughed. My shock must have shown on my face. “I told you when we moved here that we had neighbors,” he said. That was true. He did. Though, that small fact was hard to remember between the move and Mother’s funeral services. “The Waynes,” he commented, “They’re good people. You know what? There’s a late night gala happening in two weeks. I know that I don’t usually let you go to these, but how about I take you this time? I’ll introduce you to them.”</p>
    <p>I blinked up at him my mind drawing blank. There’s no way the two voices I heard in the forest came from the faces in this photo. They looked so… still. There were no smiles on their faces. Their shoulders were stiff. There were no scars on their hands or knees like I always imagined there would be. They were covered in suits. Nothing in this photo matched the carefree voices I heard. This isn’t right. This isn’t how they look when I play pretend. Maybe if I saw them, it’ll be better. “Ok,” I said, “I’ll go.”</p>
    <p>“Good,” my father said. He touched my shoulder, pulling my attention away from the photo. “Don’t’ be nervous,” he said, “How about I take you out for dinner tonight. Then I can teach you what you need to know about the gala.” I easily agreed. Although I’m not nervous, I still wouldn’t mind going out with my father tonight. “Alright,” he grunted. He lifted me up again, placing me on his shoulders. “Samantha,” he called into the house. I wasn’t even sure if the woman was back yet, but she answered. Thank goodness. “Tim and I are going out for dinner,” he called as he jogged to the door, “So no need to cook. Matter-of-fact, just take the rest of the night off.” She yelled back an ‘ok’ as my father and I left the house. His cellphone rung in his pocket as he put me down so I could enter the car, but he ignored the call. “Just you and me tonight, buddy,” he said, “But it does remind me. I got a picture for you.” He pull up a picture of a fluffy bird with black stripe along its side. Its tail-feather was a stock white. “A White-tailed Tropicbird, what you got?”</p>
    <p>I pulled out my nearly forgotten Polaroid. It crumbled in my pocket and I instantly regretted that tickle fight. Father just simply smoothed it out, a guilty smile on his face. He knew it was his fault. “A White-tailed Kite,” I said proudly. I even puffed out my chest a bit. My father gave an impressed whistle. “Pretty rare, I know.”</p>
    <p>Father snorted, the sound so typical of my father, yet so rare to hear. I really do miss him when he’s gone. “Well look at you,” he said. He tucked me under his arm and hugged me. “I’m so proud. So I guess we have to go to a good restaurant then!” He whispered to the driver where to take us but it didn’t really matter to me. My dad was back!</p>
    <p>-----</p>
    <p>Once I got back home, I had quite to story to tell my new friends. What’s even better now, I knew their faces! Though, I did wonder which face I should give the funny voice to, and which face I should give the mean voice to. Maybe I should study the photo from my father’s office. Just to make sure.</p>

    <p> <strong>The Present....</strong> </p>
    <p> <em>The third time I saw the Wayne boys, I actually saw them. They didn’t see me, but I saw them.</em> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>9 years ago...&nbsp;</strong> </p>
    <p>Father was gone again. He left in a rush, his tie skewed and his briefcase an opened heap in his arms. His hurried steps sounded down the grand hall. The sounds were the only reason I knew he was leaving. There was no pat on the head, no apologies or excuses for me to ignore. He was just gone.</p>
    <p>Ms. Samantha was gone as well, leaving in a puff of cigarette smoke as she spoke in hushed tones over her Nokia phone. She offered me a sad smile as she eased out the door, raising an umbrella over her head. She’s never quite looked at me like <em>that</em> before. “I don’t think I can,” I heard her say as the door slid shut between us, “He’s a good kid.” However the rest of her conversation was block off by the closing door. I watched from the window as she walked down the wet steps and into the rainy Gotham night. I was alone again.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The night grew darker as time went by, and the soft rain from earlier became a raging storm. The wind banged angrily against the large windows that lined the great hall, the loudest sound I’ve heard all night. Large shadows writhed along the walls as lightning flashed in bright blinding bursts. I wasn’t afraid, but the noises were too loud, the rain pelted the window a little too hard. I feared that maybe it would break. Glass would shatter everywhere, and maybe I would be swept away by the harsh winds and showering rain. Maybe it’ll blow me so hard that I’d fly away. It’ll take me to a place where the walls weren’t so big and the halls weren’t so quiet. Maybe then I wouldn’t be so alone.</p>
    <p>I knew that would never happen, but I still sat at the windowsill. My shadow was small compared the one the window frame created. I only took up a tiny space – a small corner. So small… I wondered if anyone would even notice if I was kidnapped by the wind. Father might’ve. Ms. Samantha would just be glad that she had one less mess to clean up.</p>
    <p>I placed my hand on the window as I sat, following the paths of fallen raindrops with my fingers. They were small, just like me, but they weren’t alone. They flowed together, fell powerfully together. I continued to watch them for hours, the lightning storm slowing down to a drizzle. It didn’t stop me from traced their paths with my fingers when they slowed – they became easier to follow. Then a light came on.</p>
    <p>It shown bright in the dark night, finding its way above the forest and into the upper half of my large window. Where was that light coming from? I stood on the windowsill to see, but I was still only half the height of the window, so it didn’t help much. I had all the lights off, so it wasn’t a reflection. Yet, was anyone up at this time? It was late – much later than Father would usually let me stay up. Was it the house next door?</p>
    <p>Wait, if it’s from next door would it be the boys from the picture? Or it could be the voices from the forest! (I still refuse to believe they were the same people!) Terrance and Damian, father said their names were. What where they doing up? Shouldn’t they be sleep. Then again shouldn’t I be sleep? I wonder what they’re doing. They couldn’t be playing basketball in the house, surely.</p>
    <p>Ugh, I can’t see anything from here! I began to hop from the sill, but stopped short when a shadow appeared from the light. It wasn’t the trees outside if the slow steady movement was anything to go by. It seemed like a person. The dark shadow of… an arm, I guess, slowly stretched across my window. The legs (?) were bent in an low squat as another &nbsp;shadow looked on. The first one than straightened out, gesturing to where it once was. It must want the other to copy it. The second figure did just that. It tried to repeat the step, but its shadow moved awkwardly and its arms flailed about as it toppled over.</p>
    <p>I gave a small giggle. I couldn’t be that hard. I could probably do it. I watched as the first shadow did the move again, squatting low and slow stretching an arm outward. I could totally do that. First I have to squat, easy. I tried to squat just as low as the shadow, but my thighs didn’t agree with my decision and just like the other, I toppled over. Ok, maybe it’s not as easy as I thought.</p>
    <p>I sat and watched as the second shadow tried again. It lowered itself again, slowly this time. The other shadow reached out tapped the other. No wait, was he fixing the other? Either way, the shadow didn’t fall this time. Good job! He did it! I should try again, but I can’t really see. Maybe if I used Father’s binoculars. Hopefully they’re in his office. He usually take them with him while he’s on his trips but he said that he wasn’t digging today. Maybe they’re still here.</p>
    <p>I rushed upstairs, bursting into my father’s office. He doesn’t lock the door, so it was easy to enter. I scooped the binoculars from the shelf and stood from the top of the steps. I could see them clearly from here, and to my surprise, they <em>were</em> the ones from the photo.</p>
    <p>In a room on the second floor the two boys stood in front of their open window. The tanned one, Damian if I remembered correctly, towered over the paler one, Terrance, as Terrance painfully tried to easy himself from on position to another. The poses looked difficult to do now that I could see them fully, yet Terrance continued to try. Damian nudged him periodically, correcting Terrance’s pose, slowing his movements or stopping him from falling. They concentrated on each other, Damian focusing on keeping Terrance upright, while Terrance looked to Damian for his approval. They were cool to watch, as they worked off each other, both laughing momentarily when Terrance lost his balance and Damian was too slow to catch him (or too amused to catch him). As I watched them I wondered, if these are to voices from the woods, which one was the funny one and which one was the mean one. They both seemed fun to me.</p>
    <p>The two continued on this way, Damian carefully watching Terrance until Damian jerked away from the other. He paused suddenly, blinking his eyes as if something hurt them. He then looked to the window, his sapphire blue eyes directly on me. I instantly dropped the binoculars and scrabbled to my room as fast as my legs could take me. His stare… it was <em>cold</em> and <em>scary</em>. Damian’s definitely the mean one.</p>
    <p>------</p>
    <p>That night, when I played pretend, I pretended for the first time that I was a part of it. I was practicing the moves along with the Wayne boys, and Damian corrected me just like he corrected Terrance. That night, in my room, I wasn’t so alone anymore and Damian’s icy blue stare just weren’t as scary.</p>
